# Crop Recommendation and Agricultural Trend Forecasting using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to recommend suitable crops based on various soil and environmental factors such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH levels, and rainfall. These factors are used to suggest the best crops for specific regions, improving farming practices and enhancing yields.

Additionally, the project forecasts agricultural trends using historical data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions on crop planning, resource allocation, and market strategies.

## Built With

- **Pandas** - for data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy** - for numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** - for machine learning models
- **Matplotlib** - for visualizations
- **Seaborn** - for advanced data visualization

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered soil and climate data to create a dataset for crop recommendation.
2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaned and scaled the data for model training.
3. **Model Training**: 
   - Used machine learning models, such as Random Forest, to train on the dataset.
4. **Trend Forecasting**: Implemented forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) to predict future agricultural trends based on historical data.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated model performance using accuracy scores and other relevant metrics.

## Applications

- **Crop Recommendation**: Suggesting suitable crops based on environmental conditions.
- **Trend Forecasting**: Predicting future agricultural trends for better decision-making and resource planning.

## Advantages

- **Improved Decision-Making**: Supports farmers and stakeholders by recommending the best crops.
- **Proactive Planning**: Forecasts future agricultural trends for better market and resource planning.

## Limitations

- **Data Quality**: Model accuracy depends on the quality of the data used.
- **External Factors**: Does not account for extreme weather events or pests.

## Future Scope

- Integrating live weather data through APIs.
- Expanding to predict pest outbreaks and disease trends.
- Building a mobile app to provide recommendations to farmers directly.

## Project Status

**Completed** â€” Open for contributions.
