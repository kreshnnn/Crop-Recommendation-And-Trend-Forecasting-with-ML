# Crop Recommendation and Agricultural Trend Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to recommend suitable crops based on environmental and soil factors like state, district, crop, area, and season. The model analyzes these features to suggest optimal crops for specific regions, improving farming efficiency and productivity.

Additionally, the project forecasts agricultural trends using historical data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions on crop planning, resource allocation, and market strategies.

Built with **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, this project merges traditional agricultural insights with modern machine learning techniques to optimize crop selection and forecast agricultural trends.

## Built With

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models (Random Forest, etc.)
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Advanced visualization for statistical graphics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following factors:
- **State**: Geographic location of the agricultural region
- **District**: Local level data within the state
- **Crop**: The crop being analyzed
- **Area**: The size of land used for cultivation
- **Season**: The season in which the crop is cultivated

These features are used to recommend the best crops for a specific region based on historical agricultural data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
   - Converted categorical features (state, district, season) into numerical formats using encoding techniques.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selected key features (state, district, crop, area, season) based on their importance for crop recommendation.
   - Dropped irrelevant or redundant features.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict crop recommendations based on the input features.
   - Used **train-test split** to evaluate model performance.

## Model Training

The model was trained using the **Random Forest Classifier** from `scikit-learn`:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using **train_test_split**.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to ensure reliable predictions for crop recommendations.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running the Model

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kreshnnn/Crop-Recommendation-and-Trend-Forecasting-with-ML.git

## Applications

- The model provides crop recommendations based on environmental and soil data like state, district, area, and season.
- It assists farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to cultivate for better productivity.
- Combines traditional agricultural knowledge with modern data science techniques to improve farming practices.
- Helps with efficient resource allocation by recommending crops that suit the region's available resources like land, water, and climate.

## Advantages

- Increases farming efficiency by recommending the most suitable crops, reducing wasted resources and maximizing yield.
- Optimizes resource use by suggesting crops that are better suited to the environmental conditions, leading to sustainable farming practices.
- The model is scalable, meaning it can be applied to different regions and can be updated as new data becomes available.
- The model is future-proof, meaning it can adapt to changing agricultural patterns and environmental conditions with continuous updates.

## Limitations

- The model's effectiveness is heavily dependent on the quality and completeness of the data used for training.
- It does not account for unforeseen environmental factors such as extreme weather conditions, pests, or diseases, which can impact crop growth.
- The model is primarily focused on providing short-term crop recommendations, and more advanced methods are needed for long-term forecasting.

## Future Scope

- Integrating real-time data such as weather forecasts and soil conditions to make dynamic and timely crop recommendations.
- Incorporating pest and disease prediction features to provide farmers with proactive advice on pest control and disease management.
- Using more advanced machine learning techniques, such as deep learning, to enhance trend forecasting and improve model accuracy.
- Developing a mobile application to provide farmers in rural areas with easy access to crop recommendations and data-driven insights.
