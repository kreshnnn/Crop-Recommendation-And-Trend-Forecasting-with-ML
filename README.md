# Crop Recommendation and Agricultural Trend Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to recommend suitable crops based on environmental and soil factors like state, district, crop, area, and season. The model analyzes these features to suggest optimal crops for specific regions, improving farming efficiency and productivity.

Additionally, the project forecasts agricultural trends using historical data, helping stakeholders make informed decisions on crop planning, resource allocation, and market strategies.

Built with **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**, this project merges traditional agricultural insights with modern machine learning techniques to optimize crop selection and forecast agricultural trends.

## Built With

- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **Numpy**: Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models (Random Forest, etc.)
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization
- **Seaborn**: Advanced visualization for statistical graphics

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes the following factors:
- **State**: Geographic location of the agricultural region
- **District**: Local level data within the state
- **Crop**: The crop being analyzed
- **Area**: The size of land used for cultivation
- **Season**: The season in which the crop is cultivated

These features are used to recommend the best crops for a specific region based on historical agricultural data.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and scaling numerical features.
   - Converted categorical features (state, district, season) into numerical formats using encoding techniques.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Selected key features (state, district, crop, area, season) based on their importance for crop recommendation.
   - Dropped irrelevant or redundant features.

3. **Model Selection**:
   - Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to predict crop recommendations based on the input features.
   - Used **train-test split** to evaluate model performance.

## Model Training

The model was trained using the **Random Forest Classifier** from `scikit-learn`:
- Split the dataset into training and testing sets using **train_test_split**.
- Evaluated the model using accuracy, precision, and recall metrics to ensure reliable predictions for crop recommendations.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- **Pandas**, **Numpy**, **Scikit-learn**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** (installed via `pip install -r requirements.txt`)

### Running the Model

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kreshnnn/Crop-Recommendation-and-Trend-Forecasting-with-ML.git

## Applications

  - Crop Recommendation: Suggests the most suitable crops based on various environmental and soil conditions.
- Agricultural Planning: Helps farmers and agricultural stakeholders make informed decisions by recommending the best crops for specific regions and seasons.
- Data-Driven Farming: Bridges the gap between traditional agricultural practices and modern data science, helping farmers optimize their farming methods.
- Resource Allocation: Assists in efficient use of land, water, and other resources by recommending crops best suited to the local conditions.

## Advantages

- Increased Efficiency: By recommending crops that are suitable for specific regions, the project helps improve farming efficiency and yield.
- Optimized Resource Use: Helps farmers utilize their resources more effectively by selecting crops that match their environmental conditions.
- Scalable: The model can be easily scaled to cover more regions by updating the dataset with local agricultural data.
- Future-Proofing: As agricultural trends and environmental conditions evolve, the model can be continuously updated to ensure accurate predictions.

## Limitations

- Data Quality: The model's effectiveness is dependent on the quality and completeness of the dataset. Missing or outdated data may reduce the model's accuracy.
- Environmental Factors: The model does not account for unforeseen environmental factors such as extreme weather events, pests, or diseases.
- Short-Term Focus: The model primarily focuses on short-term crop recommendations, and longer-term trends are harder to predict accurately without more advanced forecasting methods.

## Future Scope

- Real-Time Data: Integrating real-time weather data and other external sources for more dynamic crop recommendations.
- Disease and Pest Prediction: Adding features that help predict pests and diseases to assist farmers with proactive crop management.
- Advanced Forecasting Models: Implementing more complex models (e.g., neural networks or deep learning) to improve the accuracy of trend forecasting over a longer period.
- Mobile Application: Developing a mobile app to make crop recommendations accessible to farmers in remote areas, providing them with real-time advice.
